PHP/JS MediaPlayer for UPnP Devices.
===================================

**WARNING: This tool is under strong development, please be aware about!**

It's possible to accelerate UPnP Device discovery by creating a cronjob e.g. "*/1 * * * *   www-data    cd /var/www/pupnp; php discover.php"

Requirements
------------
* php5
* php5-gd
* php5-curl

or ideally add it to your crontab.
